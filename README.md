## Comparing Classifiers
### In this practical application, the goal is to compare the performance of the classifiers we encountered in this section, namely K Nearest Neighbor, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Support Vector Machines. We will utilize a dataset related to marketing bank products over the telephone. 

### After applying optimal hyperparameters all the four classifiers perfmored better than baseline 88%.
